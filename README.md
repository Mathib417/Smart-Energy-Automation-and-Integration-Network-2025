## 🚀 Overview

**SEIAN** (Smart Energy IoT-Aware Network) is a smart inverter designed to:

- Monitor the grid status in real-time  
- Share operational data with a central server  
- Perform autonomous grid fault detection and correction  
- Support seamless connection to grid or microgrid environments

## 🧠 System Architecture

Our smart inverter system includes:

### 🎯 Local Inverter Node (SEIAN Unit)

- **AC Measurement Circuitry**:  
  - Measures voltage, current, frequency, power factor, harmonics, and phase.
- **Control Processor**:  
  - Calculates parameters and generates a synchronized sine wave for grid connection.
- **SPWM Control**:  
  - Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) via H-Bridge with 4 IGBTs and driver ICs.
- **Microcontroller**:  
  - Low-level registry-based control (to be upgraded to FPGA-based for optimization).
- **Communication Subsystem**:  
  - Overseen by a Raspberry Pi, communicates to central server via HTTP protocol.

### 🖥️ Central Server

- Collects real-time data from all SEIAN units  
- Runs ML models to:
  - Detect faults (e.g., voltage sags, harmonic distortions)
  - Classify them using a neural network trained on historical/simulated grid data  
  - Send corrective commands to inverter units (adjusting voltage, frequency, phase)
